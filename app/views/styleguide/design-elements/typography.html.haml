    %h1.copy--h1 Typography
    %p
      We achieve styling through opt in classes and do not style elements globally. This is to reduced the number of style collisions across projects. Elements can inherit styles from .copy--body or otherwise applied directly.
    %p
      Typographic elements 
      %strong do not come with any margins attached to them 
      in order to make them more flexible in where they can be used.
    %p
      They get margins when they are inside a wrapper with a class of context--content. We may need to work on the naming but the principle is solid.

    %p{title: ".copy--body"}
      Here lies a bunch of body copy. The Body copy class (.copy--body) can be inherited from a parent or applied direct to any element. In this instance it is inherited. It defines the styles that represent our main text content.
      %a.copy--body__link{title: ".copy--body__link"}
        Base Link styling is inherited or can be enhanced directly using the .copy--body__link class
    %ul{title: ".copy--list"}
      %li
        This is how our unordered lists look.
      %li
        They can be inherited from copy--body or styled directly with the .copy--list class if used outside of main content.

    .copy--meta{title: ".copy--meta"} Meta copy is used for styling ancillary content, usually in the details panel, that represents details about the content rather than the actual content itself.
    .copy--caption{title: ".copy--caption"} Caption text is used primarily below images and on our cards.
    .copy--disclaimer{title: ".copy--disclaimer"} Disclaimer text is used for legal and copyright text.
