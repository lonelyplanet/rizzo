  %h1.copy--h1 Typography
  %p
    We achieve styling through opt in classes and do not style elements globally. This is to reduced the number of style collisions across projects. Elements can inherit styles from .copy--body or otherwise applied directly.
  %p
    Typographic classes are prefixed with .copy--

.card.styleguide-intro.styleguide-block.copy--body
  .copy--h1 This is our H1, typically used for the main page heading
  .copy--feature Feature text: typically used for intro paragraphs and rarely outside of copy--body. It is applied using the .copy--feature class.
  .copy--h2 
    This is our H2, it is generally used to delimit body copy.
  %p
    Here lies a bunch of body copy. The Body copy class (.copy--body) can be inherited from a parent or applied direct to any element. In this instance it is inherited. It defines the styles that represent our main text content.
    %a.copy--body__link
      Base Link styling is inherited or can be enhanced directly using the .copy--body__link class
  %ul
    %li
      This is how our unordered lists look.
    %li
      They can be inherited from copy--body or styled directly with the .copy--list class if used outside of main content.
  .copy--h3 This is our H3, commonly used for section titles
  .copy--h4 This is our H4, commonly used for subsection titles and within body copy
  .copy--h5 This is our H5, most noticeably used within the left navigation
  .copy--meta Meta copy is used for styling ancillary content, usually in the details panel, that represents details about the content rather than the actual content itself.
  .copy--caption Caption text is used primarily below images and on our cards.
  .copy--disclaimer Disclaimer text is used for legal and copyright text.
