    Cards should be included as components where possible, and always in rails apps. You can include the ui_component includes as detailed below. Cards can either be fixed or flexible width.
- cards = styleguide_stubs('cards')
- cards.each_with_index do |card, i|
  = styleguide_component('cards/card', properties: card.merge({ fixed?: true }), count: i)
